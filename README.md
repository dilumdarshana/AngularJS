# requirejs (AMD Loader)
	- Requirejs include has data tag 'data-main' which is a JS file loads as soon as require.js loads. This can use to load configurations like common libraray paths. Eg. Jquery, Angularjs etc.
	- Requirejs doesn't need '.js' extension at all on file calls
	- defind () function - look how loads util.js

# angularjs
